{{<contentTitle title="1. Domain name">}}

A good domain name (your website name} is one that is short and easy to remember. Choosing the right domain is important for your brand identity and SEO (search engine optimization), so that your business can be found easily on search engines like Bing and Google which leads to more visitors to your site.

You can purchase domain names at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/), and [iPage](https://www.ipage.com/).

{{<contentTitle title="2. Hosting">}}

Hosting is an internet service which allows your site to be accessible online; otherwise it would just be files on your computer. Without it no one will be able to view your site. When choosing a hosting company, it is important to check how reliable and secure it is, the services they offer and ensure it suits your site's needs in terms of traffic, functionality, and space.

[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/), [A2hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/) and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) are good hosting companies. Contact Codetype and We will assist you in setting up your hosting.

{{<contentTitle title="3. Purpose">}}

Why do you need a website? Are you selling products or services? Do you need to post daily, weekly or monthly articles? Are you looking for a way to engage customers or is it just a site for general company information? Finding out the purpose of your website can help you move forward in deciding how to design your site and what features or functions should be included.

{{<contentTitle title="4. Target Audience">}}

It is recommended to know who your audience is and how to keep them interested to build up your website. If your business has a young audience, you may include a bit more animation than if your audience is more elderly.


{{<contentTitle title="5. Layout and Color">}}

The colors, layout, and spacing of your website can greatly affect the look and feel of your brand identity. Focus on a neat, clean, professional layout to make your site readable but also enjoyable to look at. Good website designs are simple yet creative.

{{<contentTitle title="6. Content">}}

Your website should provide high quality and original informative content about your products or services directed to your target audience. Use keywords in your content to boost your SEO ranking. Including links to other pages on your site and other credible sources of information also helps to raise your search engine ranking.


{{<contentTitle title="7. Call to Action Buttons">}}

Call to Action buttons are the eye catchers of your website. These are usually bright or different coloured buttons, for example a red or orange button saying <span style="color: red;">Buy now</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Subscribe</span>, or <span style="color: orange;">Contact Us</span>. This is where you want your visitors to navigate to on your site. Always ensure the colors of your buttons don't conflict with your brand colors.

{{<contentTitle title="8. Images">}}

Choose images that are of high quality, clear, and memorable. Your images should be compressed as small as possible to ensure the images don't affect your website's load time. Slow load times can cost you valuable visitors. Check [Here](/articles/tips-for-speeding-up-your-website) to see How to speed up your website's performance

Also ensure your images are either free of copyright or purchased. [Istock](https://www.istockphoto.com/) and [GraphicStock](https://www.storyblocks.com/stock-image) provides tons of professional images for purchase.


{{<contentTitle title="9. Typography">}}

The biggest downfall of a website is terrible fonts. Making sure your fonts are legible is very crucial. If people have to struggle to read your site's content, they will most likely leave and not return. It is also recommended not to use all capital letters all the time, since some visitors might feel like you are yelling at them.

You can download free fonts from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/). They both have a large collection of fonts for your selection.

{{<contentTitle title="10. Easy Navigation">}}

Make your site as simple as possible to browse and navigate through. Visitors come to your site to find information, so ensure it is easy for them to find the relevant information they need. The easier it is to navigate, the higher the chances are of them returning, given you provide what they need. You can also include a site map to aid your visitors with your site's navigation.


{{<contentTitle title="11. Responsive Design (mobile-friendly design)">}}

Responsive design is a fluid like layout of your site's content, which allows it to stack as your site is viewed or resized on different screen sizes. Developing your website to be viewable across all devices increases your site's reach to more of your audience.

More than half of the internet's traffic accounts for mobile device users, so if your site is not mobile-friendly, you could be missing out on a lot of your audience. Check out How to Check Your Website's Mobile Friendliness.

{{<contentTitle title="12. Up to date">}}

Keep your website up-to-date. Websites that are not updated with news, articles or information seem dormant and users probably will not engage with you.


{{<contentTitle title="13. Advertising">}}

Do you want to advertise on your site? If yes, make sure your website is suited for ads, but do not overdo with ads all over your page to distract visitors. Too many ads are annoying.


{{<contentTitle title="14. Maintenance">}}

How will you edit your site? Will you have a web developer always available or will you edit your site by yourself?

Find out how you would like to maintain your website. If you plan on editing it yourself with wordpress or another cms, you should have some knowledge on how to use the cms or else you could really mess up your site's design. If you have a web developer, be aware this would include an additional monthly cost but better quality work will be provided.

Know which approach fits you and your business best.

{{<contentTitle title="16. Login System">}}

{{<contentTitle title="18. Tracking and Analytics">}}

Keeping track of your website's visitors and hits are important to understanding your audience more.

{{<contentTitle title="19. Security">}}
Make visitors feel safe on your site. Include a privacy policy on your site to let visitors know how you use and deal with their information, if they input any information. Security here also includes your website. Ensure your site is secure from hackers and your contact forms and comment forms are safe from spam. If you use wordpress or any other cms , use security plugins and difficult passwords with numbers, special characters and caps to increase your site's protection from invaders.

The Web is in love with icons! Today, Icons play a big role in the design and feel of many applications. If you are a UI/UX designer, graphic designer, or developer, you probably have used icons in all of your projects. Whether its web design, an app, poster, or info-graphics icons add to your project's creative appearance; and good icon sets are like gold mines for designers.
